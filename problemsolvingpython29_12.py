**1. What is the difference between list and tuple in python?**

List:
Lists are mutable
The implication of iterations is Time-consuming
The list is better for performing operations, such as insertion and deletion.
Lists consume more memory
Unexpected changes and errors are more likely to occur

Tuple:
Tuples are immutable
The implication of iterations is comparatively Faster
A Tuple data type is appropriate for accessing the elements
Tuple consumes less memory as compared to the list
In a tuple, it is hard to take place.

**2.Explain the concept of PEP 8.**

PEP 8 is a style guide for Python code. "PEP" stands for Python Enhancement Proposal, and it's a set of guidelines and best practices for writing Python code that's more readable and maintainable. Created by Guido van Rossum, PEP 8 outlines conventions for formatting, naming conventions, code structure, and overall design recommendations.

Here are some key aspects of PEP 8:

Code Layout: It suggests using 4 spaces per indentation level and limiting line length to 79 characters.

Naming Conventions: It recommends using lowercase for variable names, using underscores for variable names with multiple words (snake_case), and using CapWords for class names.

Whitespace in Expressions and Statements: It advocates for the use of whitespace to improve readability, like using spaces around operators and after commas in lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

Imports: It provides guidelines on importing modules, suggesting separating imports into different lines and ordering them in a specific sequence.

Comments: It encourages the use of comments to explain non-obvious parts of the code. Comments should be clear and concise.

Programming Recommendations: It offers advice on how to structure conditional statements, loops, and other programming constructs in a way that's clear and understandable.

PEP 8 isn't a strict set of rules that must be followed in every circumstance, but it serves as a widely accepted guide to help developers write consistent and readable Python code. Adhering to PEP 8 makes code more accessible to other developers and promotes maintainability across projects.

**3. What is the purpose of the _init_ method in Python classes?**


The __init__ method in Python classes is a special method used to initialize instances of a class. It stands for "initialize" and is also known as the constructor method. When a new instance of a class is created, the __init__ method is automatically called.

The primary purpose of __init__ is to set up the initial state of an object by assigning values to attributes or performing any necessary operations that should happen when the object is created. It allows you to define how object properties (attributes) should be initialized at the moment of instantiation.

**4. How does inheritance work in Python? Provide an example.**


Inheritance in Python allows a class (called a child or subclass) to inherit properties and behavior from another class (called a parent or superclass). This enables the child class to access attributes and methods of the parent class, reducing code duplication and promoting code reusability.

Here's an example to illustrate inheritance:
"""

# Parent class (Superclass)
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, species):
        self.species = species

    def make_sound(self):
        pass

# Child class (Subclass) inheriting from Animal
class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name):
        super().__init__('Dog')
        self.name = name

    def make_sound(self):
        return "Woof!"

# Child class (Subclass) inheriting from Animal
class Cat(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name):
        super().__init__('Cat')
        self.name = name

    def make_sound(self):
        return "Meow!"

# Creating instances of the subclasses
dog = Dog("Buddy")
cat = Cat("Whiskers")

# Accessing attributes and methods
print(f"{dog.name} is a {dog.species}. Sound: {dog.make_sound()}")  # Output: Buddy is a Dog. Sound: Woof!
print(f"{cat.name} is a {cat.species}. Sound: {cat.make_sound()}")  # Output: Whiskers is a Cat. Sound: Meow!

"""**5.Explain the difference between staticmethod and classmethod.**

In Python, both staticmethod and classmethod are decorators used to define special types of methods within a class that behave differently from regular instance methods.

staticmethod: This decorator defines a method that doesn't have access to the instance (self) or the class (cls) as its first argument. It operates like a regular function but belongs to the class's namespace. It's mainly used when a method doesn't require access to instance or class-specific data.

classmethod: This decorator defines a method that takes the class itself (cls) as the first argument instead of the instance. It can access or modify class-specific variables or invoke other class methods using the class reference.

The main difference lies in what these methods have access to:

staticmethod doesn't have access to the class or instance variables. It behaves like a regular function within the class namespace.
classmethod takes a reference to the class itself (cls) as its first argument. It can access and modify class-specific attributes or invoke other class methods using the class reference.
Choosing between staticmethod and classmethod depends on the functionality you need. Use staticmethod when a method is independent of the instance or class, and use classmethod when you need access to or manipulation of class-specific attributes or behavior within a method.






"""

class MyClass:
    @staticmethod
    def static_method(x, y):
        return x + y

# Accessed via the class itself, not an instance
result = MyClass.static_method(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 8

class MyClass:
    class_variable = 10

    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls, x):
        return cls.class_variable * x

# Accessed via the class itself, not an instance
result = MyClass.class_method(5)
print(result)  # Output: 50

"""**6.What is Polymorphism in Python? Give an example.**

Polymorphism is a core concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface (method or function) to be used for different data types or classes, providing a way for objects to be more interchangeable within a class hierarchy.

In Python, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading. Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. Method overloading, however, isn't directly supported in Python in the same way as in languages like Java or C++, but it can be achieved through different ways of handling arguments within methods.
"""

class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        pass  # Placeholder method

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Meow!"

# Function using polymorphism
def make_sound(animal):
    return animal.sound()

# Creating instances of different classes
dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

# Using the function with different objects
print(make_sound(dog))  # Output: Woof!
print(make_sound(cat))  # Output: Meow

"""In this example, Animal is the superclass with a sound method that serves as a placeholder. Dog and Cat are subclasses of Animal, and they override the sound method with their specific implementations.

The make_sound function takes an object of type Animal (or any subclass of Animal). Despite the function not being aware of the specific subclass, it can invoke the sound method on different objects, and due to method overriding, it gets the appropriate behavior specific to each class. This demonstrates polymorphism, where different objects can be treated uniformly through a common interface (sound method in this case) despite their different implementations.

**7. How do you handle exceptions in Python?**


In Python, exceptions are managed using a combination of try, except, finally, and optionally else blocks. Here's an overview of how exception handling works:

try-except block: Use try to encapsulate code that might raise an exception. If an exception occurs within the try block, Python looks for an except block that matches the raised exception type.

Handling multiple exceptions: You can handle different types of exceptions in separate except blocks or handle multiple exceptions within a single block.

else block: Optionally, you can use the else block after the except block. The code in the else block executes only if no exceptions are raised in the try block.

finally block: The finally block, if present, executes whether an exception occurs or not. It's used for cleanup operations like closing files or releasing resources.

Exception handling allows you to anticipate and manage errors or unexpected behaviors in your code, making it more robust and preventing crashes due to unhandled exceptions.

**8. Explain the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python.**



The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mutex (a mutual exclusion mechanism) that exists in the CPython interpreter, which is the default implementation of Python. The GIL is a mechanism used in CPython to ensure that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time, effectively serializing the execution of threads.

**9. What is a decorator in Python? Provide an example.
How do you implement encapsulation in Python?**


In Python, a decorator is a design pattern that allows you to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods without changing their actual code. Decorators are functions themselves that take another function as an argument and return a new function, typically adding some functionality before or after the original function's execution.
"""

# Decorator function
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

# Function to be decorated
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

# Applying the decorator to the function using '@' syntax
@my_decorator
def decorated_say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

# Calling the decorated function
decorated_say_hello()

"""In this example, my_decorator is a decorator function that takes func as an argument, defines a wrapper function that adds functionality before and after the original function's execution, and returns the wrapper function.

The decorated_say_hello function is created by applying the @my_decorator syntax above the say_hello function declaration. When decorated_say_hello() is called, it executes the wrapper function defined in my_decorator, which, in turn, executes the original say_hello function while adding extra functionality defined in the decorator.

Encapsulation in Python refers to the concept of restricting access to certain parts of an object, typically by using private and public access modifiers for attributes and methods.

**10.Explain the concept of duck typing.**

Duck typing is a concept in programming languages, particularly in dynamic languages like Python, that focuses on an object's behavior rather than its type. The term comes from the phrase "If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck." In Python, this means that the type or class of an object is less important than the methods it implements.

**11. What is the difference between append() and extend() methods for lists?**

The append() and extend() methods in Python are used to add elements to lists, but they differ in how they add those elements:

append(): This method adds a single element to the end of the list. It takes one argument, which is the element to be added.

extend(): This method adds elements from an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or any iterable object) to the end of the list. It takes an iterable as its argument and adds each element from that iterable to the list individually.

**12. How does the with statement work in Python?**

The with statement in Python is used to manage resources and ensure proper cleanup by automatically handling the acquisition and release of resources within a specific context. It's particularly useful for operations that involve opening files, working with locks, or managing connections to external resources where cleanup is necessary.

**13. Discuss the use of self in Python classes.**

In Python, self is a convention used within classes that refers to the instance of the class itself. It's the first parameter of instance methods in Python and acts as a reference to the instance that calls the method.
When an instance method is called, the instance itself is automatically passed as the first argument to the method.

self is used to access instance variables (attributes) within the class. It allows different instances of the class to have their own separate data.

**14 Explain the purpose of the _slots_ attribute.**

The __slots__ attribute in Python is used to explicitly define the attributes (instance variables) that a class can have. It allows you to restrict the set of attributes that instances of a class can have to only those specified in the __slots__ tuple.

**15.What is the difference between an instance variable and a class variable?**
**How do you implement Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism?**


Instance variables and class variables are both types of variables in Python classes, but they serve different purposes:
 Instance variables are variables that are unique to each instance of a class. They are defined within methods of the class using self.
 Class variables are variables that are shared among all instances of a class. They are defined within the class but outside of any instance methods.


Encapsulation: Encapsulation in Python is achieved by using access modifiers (like _ and __), which indicate the level of visibility of variables and methods within a class. Private variables or methods are conventionally prefixed with a single underscore (_) or double underscore (__). This convention is not strictly enforced by the language but serves as a guideline for encapsulation.

Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. In Python, abstraction can be achieved by defining interfaces, using abstract base classes (via the abc module), and focusing on exposing only essential functionalities to the user.

Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. In Python, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding, where subclasses provide specific implementations of methods inherited from a superclass, allowing them to be called uniformly.

**16.
How do you Implement single level Inheritance, multiple level inheritance, multi level inheritance, Hybrid Inheritance**

Single-Level Inheritance:

Single-level inheritance involves one class inheriting from another class. The child class (subclass) inherits attributes and methods from a single parent class (superclass).
